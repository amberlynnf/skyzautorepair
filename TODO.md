# TODO List for Linking "Learn More About Us" Button to About Page and Ensuring Top Positioning

- [x] Edit src/components/main/hero/learn-hero/LearnMore.tsx to change the onClick handler from `navigate("/contact")` to `navigate("/about")`.
- [x] Add useEffect to About.tsx to scroll to top on component mount.
- [x] Test the navigation by running the app and clicking the button to ensure it navigates to the About page and positions at the top.
